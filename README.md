# abstoggle

**abstoggle** is an audited feature toggle microservice. A feature toggle service lets teams enable or disable application features at runtime—without redeploying code — by evaluating configurable rules per environment, user, or other criteria. Built on the Quarkus subatomic Java stack, Quinoa for seamless integration, and Angular for the frontend, it serves as the upstream source for all specific project forks.

## 📦 Tech Stack

Runtime: Quarkus (Java)

Frontend UI: Angular (via Quinoa)

API Layer: REST

Auth: Integrated with Abstrauth

Data: Designed for MySql compatibility

## Pulling Baseline Updates

When Abstracore is updated with new features or security patches, pull those changes into your project fork using the provided sync script:

```bash
# From the project root, run the sync script
bash scripts/sync-base.sh
```

The script will:
- Add the `upstream` remote if it doesn't exist (pointing to Abstracore)
- Fetch the latest changes from Abstracore
- Merge the baseline changes into your project
- Pause before committing so you can review the changes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Avoid modifying the `/core` directory in your project forks. Keep your custom logic in `/app` or specific feature packages to minimize merge conflicts during updates.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

src/main/java/...: Core logic, security filters, and Abstrauth integration.

src/main/webui: The Angular application (managed by Quinoa).

docker/: Standardized deployment configurations.

scripts/: Automation for syncing with Abstracore.

## 🚀 Development Mode

Run the following command to start Quarkus in Dev Mode with the Angular live-reload server:

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```
Backend: http://localhost:8087

Frontend: Automatically proxied by Quinoa

Dev UI: http://localhost:8087/q/dev

## Things to remember

- **Backend For Frontend (BFF) Architecture** - This service must act as a BFF if it has a UI. It is the BFF for that UI.
- **Native Builds** - This service must be built as a native image (GraalVM) for optimal performance and low footprint.
- **Low footprint** - uses as little as 64MB RAM and a small amount of CPU for typical workloads, idles at near zero CPU, achieved by being built as a native image (GraalVM)
- **Based on Quarkus and Angular** - industry standard frameworks
